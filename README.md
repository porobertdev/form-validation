# form-validation - [Live Preview](https://porobertdev.github.io/form-validation/)

## About

This is a modern and clean Sign-Up form that validates user's input using the JavaScript's **Constraint Validation API** and is the part of the [assigment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-form-validation-with-javascript) from The Odin Project.

It features **live inline-validation** and a **custom dropdown component.**

The design was made in Figma, and you can find the mockup [here](https://www.figma.com/file/KL8kf0JLLnfJ5xGcvw5wRq/Sign-Up-Form?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=HFU1PuU4Gi3biMaq-1https:/).

2. Run `npm install` to install all the packages and dependencies that the project requires.

_NOTE_: `my-components` is a private repository as of writing this, thus, the `npm install` should fail.
